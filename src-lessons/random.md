Using Random Numbers
====================
Use `random(0, 90)` to get a random number between 0 and 90 (not including 90). It will be different every time you run your program!

```
pen red
for [1..4]
  fd 100
  rt random(0, 90)
```

Tasks
-----
  1. Make a random shape of your own. Try making random turns in both directions, or even having a random number of sides.

Extra
-----
  1. Did you know? You can do
  ```
  pen random(color)
  fd 100
  ```
