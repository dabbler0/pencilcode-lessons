Random Colors
=============

Use `random color` to get a random color.

```
pen random color
fd 50
```

If you use a pen thickness, remember to use parentheses:

```
pen (random color), 30
fd 50
```

Tasks
-----
  1. Make a picture with random colors, or add random colors to your old picture.

Extra
-----
You can also get random numbers for lengths or pen thickness. `random 90` gets a random number less than `90`.

```
pen red
fd 50
rt random 90
fd 50
```
You might also want to try: `moveto random position`. This will move the turtle to a random place on the screen.
