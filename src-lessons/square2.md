Making a Square, version 2
==========================
Our first square program was a little repetitive, because it was the same thing 4 times in a row. We can make it terser using a **for loop**.

```
pen red
for [1..4] # Repeat something 4 times
  fd 100 # The things to repeat must be indented
  rt 90
```

Tasks
-----
  1. Draw a different regular polygon, like a hexagon or octagon. Remember, the exterior angle of a regular polygon is 360 divided by the number of sides.
  2. Draw a different symmetrical shape, like a star or a flower. **Hint:** the exterior angles of a five-pointed star are 144 degrees.

Extra
-----
  1. Did you know? `do home` will move the turtle back to the origin. This may help you in making some symmetrical patterns.
