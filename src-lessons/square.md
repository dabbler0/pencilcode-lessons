Making a Square
===============

```
pen red
fd 100
rt 90 # Turn right 90 degrees
fd 100
rt 90
fd 100
rt 90
fd 100
```

Tasks
-----
 1. Try making another shape, like a triangle. **Hint**: the exterior angles of a triangle are 120 degrees
 2. Try drawing a house, or your own picture. **Hint**: `lt 90` turns the turtle left.

Extra
-----
 1. Did you know? `wear '/img/cat-icon'` will change the turtle into a cat.
 2. Did you know? You have access to trig functions:
    ```
    pen red
    fd 20
    rt asin(0.5) # Turn right by arcsin(0.5), or 30 degrees
    fd 20
    ```
    The functions are named `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, and `atan`.
