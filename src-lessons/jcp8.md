More Turtles
============

```
b = new Turtle()
b.rt 90
b.fd 100
lt 90
fd 100
```

`new Turtle()` creates a new Turtle; then we store it in a variable, `b`. We can tell a turtle to do something by putting `b.` before a command.

Tasks
-----
  1. Make 12 turtles go out to all the numbers on a clock. Hint: the angles between the hours of a clock are `30` degrees. Hint 2: You can use the `label` command to put the numbers on the outside of the clock.
