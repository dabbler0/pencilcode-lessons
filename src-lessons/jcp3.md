Loops
=====

```
pen red
for [1..4]
  fd 100
  rt 90
```

Make sure that `fd 100` and `rt 90` are properly indented.

Tasks
-----
  1. Try making a triangle, pentagon, or hexagon.
  2. Try making a star. Hint: the exterior angles of a star are `144` degrees.
  3. Try making your own pattern. Ideas: use curves and random colors.

Extra
-----
If your program takes a long time to run, you can use the `speed` function speed it up. For example:
```
speed 100
pen red
fd 50
```
Runs 100 times faster than normal.
